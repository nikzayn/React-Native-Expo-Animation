#React Native Animation export

In this project I have practiced how to use deploy a react-native app on expo.

#npm install expo-cli --global

#cd your-project-name

#expo start

For connecting to the simulator just start the emulator on ios/android.
Expo will automatically check it run it on that particular simulator.
